<h3 id="weeklyreadingresponses">Weekly Reading Responses</h3>

<p>On most Thursdays, I will post a prompt to get you started on a short writing assignment about the readings for the following week.<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> These should be around 300 wordsâ€”about one good page, double spaced. At the very end, they should include two possible questions for class discussion per reading (so if there are two readings that week, 4 total questions). These should be specific: questions you personally had about parts of the text, or larger questions about specific themes and arguments. These should be submitted to the <a href="https://cms.psu.edu/secure/DeepLink.asp?COURSE_ID=MRG-131217-161802-CWE1&amp;TYPE=contenttab">ANGEL Drop Box</a> before 9:05 on the morning they are due. You <strong>do not</strong> need to include the prompt in your response. You <strong>can</strong> cite outside sources if relevant and appropriate, but this is not a requirement unless explicitly stated.</p>

<p>Note: Please submit your response as a PDF, and name your file &#8220;Lastname - Reading Response N&#8221;, where N is the reading response. For example, Eley - Reading Response 1.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>January 21</strong>: Both of these readings introduce and then challenge a binary formulation of &#8220;nature&#8221; and &#8220;culture&#8221;: Sterne through the idea of sound, and Cronon through the idea of wilderness. For this response, I first want you to explain the stakes: why do these authors think it is important to challenge these notions? Then, I want you to reflect on whether or not you agree or find their reasons compelling. How do you feel about nature?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>January 28:</strong> Option 1: Idhe and Attali introduce modes of listening that we might hear as supplmentary to the three modes proposed by Chion. Expand on some of these modes, and reflect on their usefulness. How does music start to factor in to the discussion? In your opinion, is music a special case, or should we treat it like any other kind of sound?</p></li>
<li><p>Option B: If you have never worked in GarageBand (or any other DAW) very much (or at all), spend this weekend exploring the materials available at the MediaCommons and play around with adding your voice and some other audio into a project. Then write a response that reflects on what you learned, what you struggled with, and what you would like to know more about.</p></li>
