<p>This course explores the relationships between human hearing, sound recording technologies, and the idea of &#8220;nature&#8217;&#8217; from the late-nineteenth century to the present. From the outset of the recording era, the desire for recordists to capture natural sounds proved to be deeply influential on a variety of developments in sound recording technologiesâ€”which in turn shaped cultural attitudes about what it meant to listen to the natural world. In order to navigate these complex issues in American auditory culture, this course will introduce students to a variety of contemporary scholarly approaches that comprise the field of &#8221;sound studies&quot; as it is currently practiced in the humanities. </p>

<p>The class will be divided into two major units. The first, &#8220;The Nature of Sound,&#8217;&#8217; will examine how human hearing has been defined and understood over time, drawing on primary and secondary texts from sound theorists, practitioners, musicians, poets, and philosophers, among others. The second section, &#8221;The Sound of Nature,&#8217;&#8217; will examine the unique relationship between sounds and physical spaces in both the built and non-built environment. Students will critically examine issues in subjects ranging from historical ethnography and ethnomusicology to acoustics, museum studies, American environmental history, film studies, art and architectural history, experimental music, literary studies, acoustic ecology, and parks management. </p>
